# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-System
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) System is an AI-powered application that analyzes speech signals to automatically detect and classify human emotions. This system leverages machine learning and deep learning models to provide accurate emotion recognition from audio input, enabling applications in healthcare, customer service, virtual assistants, and human-computer interaction.

### Key Features:

  Emotion Classification: Detects multiple emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and more from speech.
  
  AI Models: Utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for robust performance.
  
  Feature Extraction: Extracts MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from audio for effective emotion analysis.
  
  Real-Time Analysis: Supports live or recorded audio input for instantaneous emotion detection.
  
  User-Friendly Interface: Clean interface for uploading audio files and viewing predicted emotions.

### Tech Stack:

  Backend: Python (Flask / Django)
  
  Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
  
  Machine Learning: ANN, LSTM
  
  Audio Processing: Librosa, NumPy, SciPy
  
  Deployment: Cloud hosting / Local server

### Use Case:

  SER System can be integrated into virtual assistants, call centers, mental health monitoring tools, and interactive AI applications to enhance user experience by understanding emotional context.

### Future Development:

  Multilingual Support: Extend emotion recognition to multiple languages and dialects.
  
  Enhanced Model Accuracy: Incorporate Transformer-based models like Wav2Vec or SpeechFormer for improved emotion classification.
  
  Context-Aware Analysis: Combine speech with text or facial expressions for multimodal emotion recognition.
  
  Mobile & Edge Deployment: Optimize models for mobile devices and edge computing for real-time usage.
  
  API Integration: Provide RESTful APIs for easy integration into third-party applications.
